Schedule:
Understand the difference between objects and classes
How to use Python classes
Refresher on the 4 principals of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

1. Abstraction
    -> Implementation details are hidden away
    -> You don't NEED to know how a car runs
    -> All you need to know is how to USE it
2. Inheritance
    -> Parent Child Relationship
    -> Child (IS A) Parent
    -> The child class extends the super class
    -> thereby gaining it's functionalities!
3. Encapsulation
    -> Data hiding
    -> You (the programmer) provide INTERFACES that can be used
    -> to access the state variables
4. Polymorphism
    -> The child class can operate as if it was the parent class




Python and JavaScript are 'high level interpreted languages'
